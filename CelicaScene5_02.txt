I sit across from Celica.
<Celica>
Do you like treasure hunting?
<Player>
Wha... Yeah I guess?
<Celica>
Apparently there's treasure on the second level of the dungeon.
<Player>
Is there now? What's the treasure?
<Celica>
An original copy of a magic tome.
<Player>
Oh. Interesting.
<Celica>
Would you like to join me in recovering it?
<Player>
Of course.
<Event>
Thus began our treasure hunting days.

The End. <Good End 2>
