I find Celica sitting at a table reading a book.
<Player>
H-hello.
<Event>
She looks up from the book and tilts her head.
<Celica>
Hello again.
<Event>
She goes back to reading.
<Player>
What's that book about.
<Celica>
Well...
<Event>
I talk with her about books until night.
<Event>
I leave satisfied with our conversation.
