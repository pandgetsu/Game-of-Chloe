Blank
Dungeon

<Event>
I see the figure again.
<Event>
As I approach I see a blade coming at me out of the corner of my eye.
<Event>
I roll out of the way and slam against the dungeon wall.
<Event>
I look up to see an orc preparing to strike me down once more.
<???>
Useless.
<Event>
Once more the same arrow saves my life.
<???>
If you're an adventurer, you should at least be able to handle this.
