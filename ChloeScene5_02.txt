Chloe
Dungeon

<Event>
I dodge Chloe's arrows and manage to get in range.
<Chloe>
Wha...
<Event>
I grab her right hand to keep her from drawing her bow and press the tip of my sword to her throat
<Chloe>
Good job.
<Event>
Chloe dissapears.
<Chloe>
You're good enough to manage the dungeons on your own I think.
<Event>
I spin around to find Chloe standing behind me.
<Player>
Wha...
<Chloe>
But not as good as me. 
<Event>
She smiles rather smugly.
<Player>
I really thought I had you there.
<Chloe>
There's still a lot left for you to learn.
<Chloe>
But you can learn all those things on our adventure.
<Player>
Hm?
<Chloe>
Well, you're an adventurer right?
<Player>
Yes?
<Chloe>
Then let's go on an adventure!
<Event>
She grabs my hand and starts to lead me deeper into the dungeon.
<Event>
This is how my adventuring days with Chloe began.
<Event>
The End. <True End>
