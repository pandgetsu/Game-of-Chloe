Oh so you came.
<Chloe>
Alright I guess I'll teach you to fight.
<Event>
Chloe goes over the basics with you.
<Chloe>
Alright let's call it a day.
<Chloe>
You're still far from my level, but you're coming along nicely.
<Player>
Thank you very much.
<Player>
Is it alright if I come back again?
<Chloe>
Hahaha, sure if you'd like.
<Player>
Thank you!
<Chloe>
Hahaha, you're an interesting guy.
<Event>
I go back to the tavern.
